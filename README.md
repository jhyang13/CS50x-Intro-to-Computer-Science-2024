# CS50x-Intro-to-Computer-Science-2024

### Overview
This repository contains my work for CS50x, Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science course, offered through edX. CS50x covers a broad range of fundamental topics in computer science and programming, providing a deep dive into concepts such as algorithms, data structures, memory management, web development, and more.

### Course Content
The course includes the following topics and assignments:

- Week 0: Scratch
  - Introduction to programming concepts using Scratch.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 0.

- Week 1: C
  - Basics of C programming: variables, loops, conditions.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 1.

- Week 2: Arrays
  - Arrays and strings in C.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 2.

- Week 3: Algorithms
  - Sorting and searching algorithms.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 3.

- Week 4: Memory
  - Pointers and memory management in C.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 4.

- Week 5: Data Structures
  - Linked lists, hash tables, and more.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 5.

- Week 6: Python
  - Introduction to Python programming.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 6.
  - Special Lecture: Artificial Intelligence.
  - Concepts in AI and machine learning.

- Week 7: SQL
  - Introduction to databases and SQL.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 7.

- Week 8: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Basics of web development.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 8.

- Week 9: Flask
  - Web application development using Flask.
  - Assignment: Problem Set 9.

- Week 10: Cybersecurity
  - Understanding cybersecurity principles.

- Final Project
  - An open-ended project where I applied what I learned in the course to create something of my own.

### Getting Started
To run the code examples and problem sets in this repository, you'll need to have the following installed:
- C Compiler (such as GCC)
- Python 3 and pip
- Flask (for web development)
- SQLite (for SQL projects)
- Any modern web browser (for HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects)

### Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository, run:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CS50x-Intro-to-Computer-Science-2024.git

### Usage
Each week's content is organized into separate folders. Inside each folder, you will find the problem set code, any supporting files, and a README file that explains the specifics of the assignment.

### Example
- To run a C program:
bash
Copy code
cd Week1-C
make hello
./hello

- To run a Python script:
bash
Copy code
cd Week6-Python
python3 script.py
